Introduction
------------

This document contains some important tips on compiling and developing for
specific platforms.

Compiling The Source
--------------------

Basic Build Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  C (C11) compiler (``gcc``, ``clang``, etc)
-  Python >= 3.5
-  meson >= 0.48.0 (build system; >=0.49.0 recommended)
-  ninja >= 1.7
-  docutils

You can optionally install `other dependencies <../README.rst#dependencies>`__,
but the build system will pull in everything else you might need otherwise.

First, you'll want to set up a prefix for where the game's binaries  will be
installed. For starting out development, you're better off installing it to
your HOME directory.

::

    export TAISEI_PREFIX=/home/$user/bin

To build and install Taisei on \*nix:

::

    cd /path/to/taisei/source
    mkdir build
    cd build
    meson --prefix=$TAISEI_PREFIX # configures the build directory
    ninja # compiles the code
    ninja install # installs the binary and assets


Development
-----------

Build Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Game Data Path
""""""""""""""

When compiling with ``--prefix=$TAISEI_PREFIX``, game file data will be
installed to ``$TAISEI_PREFIX/share/taisei/``, and this path will be built
*statically* into the executable. You can decide whether or not you want this
based on your own preferences. Alternatively, you can install game data
relatively as well:

::

  meson configure -Dinstall_relative=true

Which will cause save game data to be installed to:

::

    $TAISEI_PREFIX/taisei/
    $TAISEI_PREFIX/data/

Note that ``install_relative`` is always set when building for Windows.

Debugging
"""""""""

You can enable debugging options/output for development purposes:

::

    meson configure -Dbuildtype=debug -Db_ndebug=false


Faster Builds
"""""""""""""

This option also helps for speeding up build times, although there is a
theoretical reduction in performance with these options:

::

    meson configure -Db_lto=false -Dstrip=false


Developer Mode
""""""""""""""

For debugging actual gameplay, you can set this option and it will enable cheats
and other 'fast-forward' options by the pressing keys defined in
``src/config.h``.

::

    meson configure -Ddeveloper=true

Stack Trace Debugging
"""""""""""""""""""""

This is useful for debugging crashes in the game. It uses
`AddressSanitizer <https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer>__`:

::

    meson configure -Db_sanitize=address,undefined

Depending on your platform, you may need to specify the specific library binary
to use to launch ASan appropriately. Using macOS as an example:

::

    export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/clang/12.0.0/lib/darwin/libclang_rt.asan_osx_dynamic.dylib

And then launch Taisei's binary from the command line:

::

    /path/to/Taisei.app/Contents/MacOS/Taisei

The ``../12.0.0/..`` in the path of ``DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`` changes with each
version of XCode. If it fails to launch for you, ensure that the version number
is correct.

Deprecation Errors
""""""""""""""""""

You can force deprecation warnings to become errors with the following option.

Useful for making sure your code is using best-practices.

::

    meson configure -Dwerror=true -Ddeprecation_warnings=no-error


OpenGL ES Support (Optional)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The OpenGL ES 3.0 backend is not built by default. To enable it, do:

::

    meson configure -Dr_gles30=true -Dshader_transpiler=true

See `here <doc/ENVIRON.rst>`__ on how to manually activate it.

To set OpenGL ES 3.0 as the *default* renderer, do:

::

    meson configure -Dr_default=gles30

The OpenGL ES 2.0 backend can be enabled similarly, using ``gles20`` instead of
``gles30``. However, it requires a few extensions to be present on your system
to function correctly, most notably:

- ``OES_depth_texture`` or ``GL_ANGLE_depth_texture``
- ``OES_standard_derivatives``
- ``OES_vertex_array_object``
- ``EXT_frag_depth``
- ``EXT_instanced_arrays`` or ``ANGLE_instanced_arrays`` or
  ``NV_instanced_arrays``

For Windows and macOS, you will need Google's ANGLE library for both ES 3.0 and
2.0. You'll need to check out
`ANGLE <https://github.com/google/angle>`__ and build it first. Refer to their
documentation on how to do that.

Once you've compiled ANGLE, enable it with:

::

    meson -Dinstall_angle=true -Dangle_libegl=/path/to/libEGL.{dll,dylib}
    -Dangle_libgles=/path/to/libGLESv2.{dll,dylib}

Ensure you use the correct file extension for your platform. (``.dll`` for
Windows, ``.dylib`` for macOS.)

It'll install automatically with ``ninja install`` (as mentioned above).

Coding Style
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the ``*.c`` files, tabs are used. In the ``meson.build`` and ``*.py`` files,
spaces are used.

To help you abide by this standard, you should install
`EditorConfig <https://github.com/editorconfig>`__ for your preferred editor of
choice, and load in the file found at ``.editorconfig`` in the root of the
project.

Platform-Specific Tips
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
"""""""""""""""""""""

On an apt-based system (Debian/Ubuntu), ensure you have build dependencies
installed:

::

    apt-get install meson cmake build-essential
    apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libogg-dev libopusfile-dev libpng-dev libzip-dev libx11-dev libwayland-dev

macOS
"""""

On macOS, you need to begin with installing the Xcode Command Line Tools:

::

    xcode-select --install

There are additional command line tools that you'll need. You can acquire those
by using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__.

Follow the instructions for installing Homebrew, and then install the following
tools:

::

    brew install meson cmake pkg-config docutils imagemagick pygments

The following dependencies are technically optional, and can be pulled in at
build-time, but you're better off installing them yourself to reduce compile
times:

::

    brew install freetype2 libzip opusfile libvorbis webp sdl2

As of 2020-02-18, you should **not** install the following packages via
Homebrew, as the versions available do not compile against Taisei correctly.
If you're having mysterious errors, ensure that they're not installed.

* ``spirv-tools``
* ``spirv-cross``
* ``sdl2_mixer``

Remove them with:

::

    brew remove spirv-tools spirv-cross sdl2_mixer


Taisei-compatible versions are bundled and will be pulled in at compile time.

In addition, if you're trying to compile on an older version of macOS
(e.x: <10.12), SDL2 may not compile correctly on Homebrew (as of 2019-02-19).
Let ``meson`` pull in the corrected version for you via subprojects.

**NOTE:** While Homebrew's optional dependencies greatly improve compile times,
if you can't remove packages that give you errors from your system for whatever
reason, you can force ``meson`` to use its built-in subprojects by using the
following option:

::

    meson --wrap-mode forcefallback

Windows
"""""""

While the game itself officially supports Windows, building the project
directly on Windows is a bit difficult to set up due to the radically different
tooling required.

However, you can still compile on a Windows-based computer by leveraging Windows
10's
`Windows For Linux (WSL) Subsystem <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>__`
to cross-compile to Windows.

Graphical Assets
----------------

Taisei's GFX library is made up of a collection of sprites, shaders, and a few
3D models. The 3D models are almost exclusively used for background scenery
(and a few other places, like the HUD), while the sprites are used in everything
from UI elements, character portraits, to the
danmaku bullets themselves.

To modify the 3D models, you'll need `Blender <https://blender.org>`__, which is
free and open source. Look for tutorials on YouTube for how to use it. The
models themselves are located in ``resources/00-taisei.pkgdir/models``.

Taisei uses ``.obj`` for its 3D models. To export ``.obj`` files from Blender,
use ``File -> Export -> Wavefront (.obj)``. Ensure that the following settings
are used:

::

    Include
        Objects as OBJ Objects: ENABLED

    Transform
        Forward: Y Forward
        Up: -Z Up

    Geometry
        Write Materials: DISABLED
        Triangulate Faces: ENABLED

Music and sound effects are located in ``resources/00-taisei.pkgdir/sfx``.

For sprites, any image editor will do. Sprites are located in ``atlas``.
However, to have sprites properly appear in Taisei, you'll need a few packages
and tools first to rebuild the atlas so the game can load them properly.

You'll need ``rectpack`` and ``pillow`` from ``Python PIP``:

::

    pip3 install rectpack pillow

You'll also need to download (and/or compile) and install
`Leanify <https://github.com/JayXon/Leanify>`__.

You'll need to run one of the following commands to regenerate the ``atlas``
once the sprites have been modified. Pay attention to which directory you've
made your changes in (such as ``common_ui``) and use the appropriate command.`

::

    ninja gen-atlas-common_ui
    ninja gen-atlas-common
    ninja gen-atlas-portraits

Or, to regenerate *everything*:

::

    ninja gen-atlases

That will regenerate the files needed for your new sprites to appear correctly.

*Generally speaking*, Taisei prefers ``.webp`` as the final product, but can
convert ``.png`` into ``.webp`` using the above ``ninja gen-atlas*`` commands.
